# üìö DBMS Questions and Answers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Normalization?  
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Primary Key vs Foreign Key  
- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table.  
- **Foreign Key:** Refers to the primary key in another table to create a relationship.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are Constraints?  
Constraints are rules applied to table columns (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Surrogate Key?  
A surrogate key is an artificial key (like an auto-increment ID) used when no natural primary key exists.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you avoid data redundancy?  
By using normalization, proper table design, and relationships using primary and foreign keys.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is an ER Diagram?  
An ER diagram is a visual representation of entities and their relationships in a database.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Relationships in DBMS  
- One-to-One  
- One-to-Many  
- Many-to-Many  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT  
It automatically generates a unique value for a primary key column in a table.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Default Storage Engine in MySQL  
**InnoDB** is the default storage engine.

### üîü What is a Composite Key?  
A composite key is a primary key created using two or more columns together.
